Description: Dataverse (formerly Common Data Service - CDS) is Microsoft’s 
    unified data storage for all business applications marketed under the Power 
    Apps umbrella. As many companies are using Microsoft’s tech stack, 
    Dataverse is an important data source for analysts and data scientists. 
    The goal of this package is to make it dead simple to get your data from 
    (and to) your Dataverse instance and leverage its rich metadata to automate 
    data analysis tasks. The package offers a suite of pipeable, simple to use 
    functions shielding the user from the unmemorizable syntax of Odata 
    requests and ensuring correct conversion of data types 
    (looking at you picklists!).
